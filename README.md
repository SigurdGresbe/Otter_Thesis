# Otter_Thesis
Bachelor Thesis 



To run the software standalone or the simulator, run the main.py file.

If you want to run your own control algorithm, import the Otter_api and create an object. This object has multiple functions that can be called, 
including "update_values" which will gather all the data from the Otter and update a dictionary tied to the otter object with all values recieved
from the Otter and a few that are calculated.
